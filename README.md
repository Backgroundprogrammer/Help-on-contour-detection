# Help-on-contour-detection
I need some help on contour detection. I am using canny edge detection but I have no idea how to draw detection box. 
Went to search online and found out that I need to detect contour first before drawing detection box. 
But I do not know how to detect contour. I am using EMGU CV 3.1.0 version for my C# coding. Please help..
